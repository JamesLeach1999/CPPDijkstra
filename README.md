Implementing Dijkstras algorithm in CPP with no tutorial or outside help


I had already implemented Dijkstras algorithm into JS using a tutorial, but I wanted to do it in C++ too.
_t was harder than I expected. With the main difficulty being around adding edges for the nodes, hence why there are lines in the main function of me doing it manually. I experimented with pointers and passing by value, but nothing worked so ultimately I had to just do it manually.

There are many more considerations implementing in C++. With JS objects workwith all types by default, making things alot easier. I also experimented with min binary heaps for the queue but this gave unexpected results. So I setteled on using the built in priority queue with the standard library along with pairs.

Not the easiest code to read, but I was proud with the result for the effort I put in so I wanted to showcase it._
